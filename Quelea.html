<p>Quelea is a Haskell library that helps programmers develop highly
scalable applications on the top of eventually consistent NoSQL
stores, such as Cassandra. You can think of Quelea as a mediator
between the application programmer and the underlying NoSQL store. It
understands both the application requirements and the store semantics,
and helps programmers use NoSQL stores in such a way so as to maximize
performance <em>and</em> ensure correct application behaviour, both at the
same time!
<!-- The programmer is perfectly aware of the requirements of her
application, but she need not necessarily understand the complex
low-level semantics of NoSQL stores. Consequently, she may not know
how to configure the store so as to maximize the performance of her
application, while guaranteeing its correctness. Moreover, different
NoSQL stores have different semantics, so, if programmer wishes to
port her application across a different NoSQL store, she has to go
through the process of understanding and configuring the store all
over again. In such cases, Quelea comes to the rescue of
programmer --></p>

<p>Among other things, Quelea library implements:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that lets NoSQL application
programmers declare the consistency requirements of their
applications as <em>contracts</em> (also called <em>specifications</em>),</li>
  <li>A static contract classification procedure that maps high-level
application contracts to appropriate low-level consistency
guarantees provided by the underlying NoSQL store, and</li>
  <li>A run-time that runs application operations after tuning the store
consistency to appropriate levels as determined by the contract
classification procedure.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the implementations of DSL and the static contract
classification components are largely independent of the actual NoSQL
store used, the current implementation of run-time component is
tailor-made to work with the Cassandra data store.</p>

<p>If you’d like to understand the theory and engineering that powers
Quelea, then please read our <a href="http://gowthamk.github.io/docs/quelea.pdf">PLDI’15
paper</a>, or go through the
<a href="http://gowthamk.github.io/docs/Quelea-PLDI15.pptx">slides</a> from our
PLDI’15 presentation at Portland. On a lighter note, below is a
tongue-in-cheek video about how Quelea helps Cassandra be more
approachable to users :-)</p>

<h2 id="install-quelea">Install Quelea</h2>

<p><strong>Via an installer</strong>: If you are running Ubuntu (14.04 64-bit), then
installing quelea is very easy - download the <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/sss/projects/quelea/quelea-oss.tar.gz">tar.gz</a>,
untar it, and run the install script. You should be good to go.</p>

<p><strong>Via cabal</strong>: Quelea Haskell package is also available via Cabal, the
Haskell package manager. If you have <code>ghc</code> and <code>cabal</code> installed on
your machine, then you can install Quelea by running:</p>

<pre><code>cabal install quelea --disable-library-profiling
</code></pre>

<p>Please note that Quelea requires Microsoft’s z3 theorem prover and
Datastax’s Cassandra data store, which cannot be installed via cabal.
On Mac OS X, you can install z3 using homebrew: <code>brew install z3</code>.
Installing cassandra is also easy: please follow the instructions
<a href="http://www.datastax.com/2012/01/working-with-apache-cassandra-on-mac-os-x">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Use a VM</strong>:On the other hand, if you want to quickly see Quelea in action,
<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/dd1nzms16ihlggl/Quelea.ova?dl=0">download the VM</a>, and follow the instructions
<a href="/Quelea/prelims.html">here</a> to run the benchmark suite.</p>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<p>Quelea is a programming framework that encourages scalability oriented
development. So, the best way to get started with Quelea is to develop
small, but highly scalable NoSQL applications. We wrote a couple of
tutorials to help you in this process:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/Quelea/counter-tutorial.html">A monotonically increasing counter</a> (to count youtube video views,
for example).</li>
  <li><a href="/Quelea/microblog-tutorial.html">A microblogging application</a> (very much like Twitter).</li>
</ul>

<p>Happy programming!</p>
