        <h2>Monotonically Increasing Counter</h2>
<!-- p class="meta">04 Oct 2015</p -->

<div class="post">
<p>Let us say we are developing a YouTube-like video streaming service,
called MyTube.  One particularly impressive aspect of YouTube is its
global reach: regardless of where they are originally uploaded, videos
are made available to audience across the globe, allowing them to
quickly go <em>viral</em>. In general, the number of <em>views</em> a video garners
on youtube from across the globe is a good metric for its success, and
even fuels its further <em>virality</em>. Following YouTube, we might want
MyTube to be available to viewers across the globe, and considering
the importance of displaying the number of views, we might also want
to equip MyTube with a view counter. MyTubeâ€™s view counter should be
able to count the number of times a video was watched, notwithstanding
the fact that a video can be watched simultaneously by users in
different parts of the world. How do we implement such a counter?</p>

<p>In order for MyTube to be highly available with low latency for global
audience, it is imperative to geo-replicate its data across servers in
different parts of the world (Each server maintains a <em>replica</em> of
data):</p>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/georeplication.png" alt="georeplication" /></p>

<p>Since we want to keep track of the view count for videos, we might
associate an integer <code>count</code> with every <code>video_id</code>:</p>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/georeplication2.png" alt="georeplication2" /></p>

<p>Note that <code>count</code> should reflect the number of views the video has
accumulated across the globe, not just at a single replica. Therefore,
whenever a video is streamed from a replica, (a). its <code>count</code> has to
be incremented up locally, and (b). this update needs to be propagated
to every other replica globally. One way to achieve this is by bumping
up the count synchronously across all replicas. But, synchronization
(also called <em>strong consistency</em> (SC)) is very expensive as
communication latency over internet is arbitrarily high, and can even
be infinite in case of network partitions: </p>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/partitions.png" alt="partitions" /></p>

<p>High latency means low availability, which is bad for MyTube users.
This is precisely the reason why highly available services like Google
and Amazon do not rely on strongly consistent data replication. In
general, they rely on data stores that offer a weaker form of
consistency, called <em>Eventual Consistency</em>(EC). Under eventual
consistency, updates to multiple replicas of data are not performed
synchronously.  Instead, an update is first performed locally, and is
only <em>eventually</em> propagated to all other replicas. Data stores that
offer eventually consistent data replication by default are called
Eventually Consistent Data Stores (ECDS). Many off-the-shelf ECDS,
such as Cassandra, Riak, Redis, mongoDB, and couchDB, are available as
free software over the internet. <!--As we shall see later in this
tutorial, simple eventual consistency is not enough in all the cases;
occassionally we do require stronger forms of replication, albeit not
as strong as SC. Recognizing this need, different stores provide
various features that let us achieve stronger data replication. -->
Quelea uses Cassandra as its underlying EC store. We shall now see how
Quelea lets us write a highly available view counter over an
eventually consistent data store, without we ever having to understand
how the underlying store (Cassandra) works.</p>
