        <h2>RUBiS Benchmark</h2>
<!-- p class="meta">11 Feb 2015</p -->

<div class="post">
<p>RUBiS is an eBay-like auction that allows users to browse for items,
bid for items on sale, and pay for items from a wallet modelled after
a bank account. To support the rich functionality, RUBiS implements a
large number of operations and transactions requiring varying levels
of consistency and isolation, respectively. The primary purpose of
this benchmark is to study the impact of using Quelea in such a
real-world setting (Fig. 9(c) of the <a href="http://gowthamk.github.io/docs/quelea.pdf">paper</a>); We
would like to demonstrate significant performance gains obtained by
annotating operations/transactions with Quelea contracts, which would
otherwise need to be executed with strong consistency/isolation to
guarantee correctness. Another purpose of this benchmark is to
demonstrate the scalability of static contract classification, as
shown in the following section.</p>

<h3 id="building-the-benchmark">Building the benchmark</h3>

<p>Navigate to <code>~/git/quelea/tests/Rubis</code>, and run <code>make</code>. On the stdout,
along with GHCâ€™s build information, you should find something similar
to the following getting printed:</p>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-make2.png" alt="rubis-make2" /></p>

<p>The above lines indicate the consistency class for each RUBiS
operation, along with the time taken to classify the operation, and
also the total time consumed by the contract classification procedure.
Similar information is also displayed for RUBiS transactions: </p>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-make1.png" alt="rubis-make1" /></p>

<p>As sample runs demonstrate, compile-time overhead of classifying each
operation/transaction is very low, and the total overhead of contract
classification is roughly the sum of overheads incurred in each case.</p>

<p>Successful compilation generates two binaries - <code>Rubis</code> and
<code>Rubis_strong</code>. The former uses Quelea contracts to declare
consistency/isolation requirements of Rubis operations/transactions,
whereas the latter simply runs everything under strongest possible
consistency and isolation guarantees.</p>

<h3 id="running-the-benchmark">Running the Benchmark</h3>

<p>We start with an experiment to measure latency and throughput, when
one auction is open and (the default) 3 buyers are bidding for the
item.  We take the measurements for each of the <code>Rubis</code> and
<code>Rubis_strong</code> cases. The commands to execute, and output generated in
our sample runs are shown below.  Like our other benchmarks,
experiments can be terminated either manually (via <code>CTRL+C</code>), or by
setting a hard time limit via <code>--terminateAfter</code> option, which accepts
number of seconds as argument.</p>

<h3 id="rubis">Rubis</h3>

<pre><code> ./Rubis --kind Daemon --numAuctions 100 --numBuyers 3 --delayReq 1000 --numItems 1
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-q1.png" alt="rubis-q1" /></p>

<p>Once you have aggregate latency and throughput data, terminate the
experiment by pressing <code>CTRL-C</code>. If you have encountered an error, or
if you suspect that execution is not making progress, please refer to
the <a href="/Quelea/troubleshooting.html">troubleshooting guide</a>
for quick fix.</p>

<h3 id="rubis-strong">Rubis Strong</h3>

<pre><code> ./Rubis_strong --kind Daemon --numAuctions 100 --numBuyers 3 --delayReq 1000 --numItems 1
</code></pre>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-sc1.png" alt="rubis-sc1" /></p>

<p>We now repeat experiments after increasing the number of concurrent
auctions to 8, and number of buyers per auction to 10. Screenshots
capturing measurements for sample runs are shown below:</p>

<h3 id="rubis-1">Rubis</h3>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-q-8-10.png" alt="rubis-q-8-10" /></p>

<h3 id="rubis-strong-1">Rubis Strong</h3>

<p><img src="/Quelea/assets/rubis-sc-8-10.png" alt="rubis-sc-8-10" /></p>

<h3 id="observations">Observations</h3>

<p>As demonstrated in sample runs, experiments should let us infer that,
while both <code>Rubis</code> and <code>Rubis_strong</code> preserve necessary semantic
guarantees (e.g: only the buyer who wins the auction gets billed), the
former does so while delivering orders of magnitude higher throughput
and lower latency than the latter.</p>
